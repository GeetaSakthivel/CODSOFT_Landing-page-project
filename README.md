# CODSOFT_Landing-page-project

## Overview
This project is designed as a beginner-level web development exercise aimed at building a landing page using **HTML** and **CSS**. Through this project, I get hands-on experience with fundamental web development concepts like creating columns, dividing sections, arranging items, and adding headers and footers. It's also an excellent opportunity to practice my design skills by experimenting with **alignments**, **padding**, **color palettes**, and other layout elements.

## Features
- Basic webpage layout using **HTML** and **CSS**.
- **Headers**, **footers**, and multiple content sections.
- Properly arranged columns and sections.
- Aesthetic design with a focus on user experience.
- Attention to detail, including spacing, colors, and avoiding overlapping elements.

## Tools & Technologies
